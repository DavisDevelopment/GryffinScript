GryffinScript
=============

JS-Like Scripting Language for the Gryffin Engine

===

GryffinScript is, essentially, a subset of javascript. There are, however, a few features not present in JS.
Like `unless` and `until` clauses, built-in module support, and magic-methods. More documentation is coming soon.
